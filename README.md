# BloodWorkEasy

USACSHack-aton 

Our original idea was a blood work reader that reads pdf templates of blood work, checks your hormones/levels, and gives suggestions. Due to time and debugging issues, we instead make user-friendly software from which the subject can input their values into the code to get the output of suggestions and reading of their levels. 

We aimed to solve the problems of the cost of a doctor consultation, lack of understanding of blood work, a lack of standardized blood work, and an abundance of vitamin deficiencies/health conditions. 

We used Android Studio with an emulator and wrote our code in java. We ran into an issue with the deployment of our app onto the emulator as this was our first run using android studios in this manner. The front-end section of the code was to implement with the emulator. The back-end code was written in java and displayed a basic skeleton for the front-end code. 

Thank you for reading this!
